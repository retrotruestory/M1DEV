# Magic-1-Architecture-and-software-knowledge-base
Magic-1 is a completely homebuilt minicomputer created by <a href="https://www.magic-1.org/">Bill Buzbee</a>. <br> 
The CPU was designed using only TTL and microcode. 
The computer uses a specially modified version of <a href="https://minix1.woodhull.com/">Minix</a>  2.0.4.


  Important note: the following data is not official data but my attempt to understand and summarize how Magic 1 works.<br>
  There may be errors in the text - if one is found - please let me know about it so that I can make corrections in it. <br>
  The official source of data on Magic 1 architecture is available here: <a href="https://www.magic-1.org/">www.magic-1.org</a>

  At the moment, the Minix system is an integral part of the Magic 1 architecture (as it is necessary to use some of the computer's functions).<br>
  Minix has been released under the BSD-3-Clause license since April 2000, for the sake of unification of the whole project, the rest of the<br> data such as the description of the architecture/software will 
  be released under the same license. 


The primary goal is to collect as much information as possible about this computer and present it in a way that makes it easier to understand<br> its architecture and how it functions.<br>
All up-to-date, verified and verified information is now available in the form of a small encyclopedia about Magic-1 <a href="https://github.com/retrotruestory/M1DEV/wiki">here</a>.
